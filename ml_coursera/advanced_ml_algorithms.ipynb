    "### Intuition \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are based on the biological neurons and how they are in a network. A neural network in machine learning is based on a simplified mathematical model of a neuron. In a neural network, a **neuron** takes in an input layer $\\vec{x}$ of $x$ features, feeds the input to a **neuron layer** which has $k$ **activations**. A neuron layer are sometimes known as \"hidden layer\" and it is possible for there to be multiple. If there are $l$ layers, the lth layer outputs a vector $\\vec{a}^{[l]}$ of which has $k_l$ activations. The final neuron layer can be used as the input for a second neuron. The output of each layer is used for the next layer. A neural network is a collection of these neurons that are all connected. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the output vector for a layer $l$, denoted $\\vec{a}^{[l]}$, we use the sigmoid function $$g(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\vec{w} \\cdot x + b)}}$$ from logistic regression. We call $g(z)$ the **activation function**. For feature $j$ of the output, we use the formula: $$a_j^{[l]} = g(\\vec{w}_j^{[l]} \\cdot \\vec{a}^{[l-1]} + b_j^{[l]})$$ where $a_j^{[l]}$ is the activation value of layer $l$, unit (neuron) $j$. We call the input layer $\\vec{x} = \\vec{a}^{[0]}$.\n",

    "### Decision Tree Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a training set of n examples, we need to follow a process of learning for our decision tree: \n",
    "1. How to choose what features to split on at each node to maximise purity/minimsie inpurity. \n",
    "2. When to stop splitting? \n",

    "   * When improvements in purity score are below a threshold.\n",
    "   * When number of examples in a node is below a threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measuring Purity\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use **entropy** as a way to measure impurity in our decision tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a classification problem with n classes, $c_n$ and $c_2$. Let $p_n$ be the fraction of examples that are class $c_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy of class $c_n$ is denoted as $H(p_n) = -p_n \\log_{2}(p_n) - (1-p_n) \\log_{2}(1-p_n)$. We use $\\log_{2}$ to get the peak of the function to be at when $H(p_n)=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing a split: Information Gain\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are faced with choices of which feature to split on, we calculate the Information Gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Gain is a measure of how much information a feature provides about a class. It helps to determine the order of attributes in the nodes of a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let: \n",
    "$$\n",

    "& p_1^{root} = \\text{ the fraction of examples that are positive in the root node.} \\\\\n",

    "1. Start with all examples at the root node\n",
    "2. Calculate information gain for all posible features, and pick the feature with the highest information gain. \n",
    "3. Split dataset according to selected feature, and create left and right branhces of the tree. \n",
    "4. Keep repeating the splitting process until the stopping criteria is met: \n",
    "    * When a node is 100% one class.\n",
    "    * When splitting a node will result in the tree exceeding a maximum depth. \n",
    "    * Information gain from additional splits is less than threshold. \n",
    "    * When number of examples in a node is below a threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-Hot Encoding of Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "One Hot Encoding is when if a categorical feature can take on $k$ values, then create $k$ binary features (0 or 1 valued). This can be used not only for decision trees, but also for neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continuous Valued Features\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a decision tree to use a continuous valued feature, you choose a constraint to split the feature into two classes. To decide on the constraint, you calculate the information gain based on multiple constraints and go with the constraint with the maximum information gain. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tree Ensembles\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A weakness of using a single decision tree is that the decision tree can be highly sensitive to small changes in the data. A solution to this is to build multiple decision trees. This is called a **tree ensemble**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using multiple decision trees allows you to capture any loopholes in the trees. For your classification, you go with the most popular outcome from each decision tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest Algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest algorithm is much more effective than using a single decision tree. Random Forests involve using sampling by replacement to create alternative training sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a training set $t_1$ of size $m$, for $b=1$ to $B$, you can use sampling with replacement to create a new training set $t_2$ of size $m$ and train a decision tree on the new data set $t_2$. We repeat this until we have a decision tree trained on the data set $t_B$, i.e. a total of $B$ times. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is reccomended that $B$ is large, but not too large as too large of a $B$ can result in diminishing returns from the algorithm. It is reccomended that $B \\le 100$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that we do not have the same feature at the root node, we need to randomise the feature choice. At each node, when choosing a feature to use to split, if $n$ features are available, pick a random subset of $k < n$ features and allow the algorithm to only choose from that subset of features. A typical choice for the value of $k$ when $n$ is large is $k = \\sqrt{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of decision tree ensembles is using a boosted decision tree ensemble. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to a Random Forest, but with a slight modification as seen below: \n",
    "- Given a training set of size $m$, for $b=1$ to $B$: \n",
    "  - Use sampling with replacement to create a new training set of size $m$. Instead of picking from all examples with equal $\\frac{1}{m}$ probability, make it more likely to pick misclassified examples from previously trained trees. \n",
    "- Train a decision tree on the new dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "**XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)** is an open source implementation of boosted trees that is fast and efficient. XGBoost provides a good choice of default splitting criteria and criteria for when to stop splitting. Also, it has built in regularisation to prevent overfitting. \n",
