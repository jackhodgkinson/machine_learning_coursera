It is likely that these will include a few anomalous examples ($y=1$) but mostly normal examples ($y=0$).

    "## Reinforcement Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is reinforcement learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is about mapping the state $s$ to an action $a$ and \"rewarding\" the function when it does the right thing by using a **reward function**. For example, this could be through assigning it a positive value for doing the right thing, and a large negative value for doing something wrong. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning has a variety of applications such as: \n",
    "* Controlling robots\n",
    "* Factory optimisation\n",
    "* Financial (stock) trading\n",
    "* Playing games\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### The Return\n",
    "\n",
    "The Return captures the idea that rewards you can get quicker are more attractive and appealing than rewards that take longer to achieve. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Return for } R_n = R_1 + \\sum_{i=2}^n R_i (\\gamma)^i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where: \n",
    "* $R_i$ is the reward at each state. \n",
    "* $\\gamma$ is the discount factor (a number close to 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reward is based on which actions $a$ you take. \n",
    "\n",
    "In between the state and action, we have a policy $\\pi$ which job is to take an input state $s$ and map it to the action $a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the goal of reinforcement learning is to find a policy $\\pi$ that tells you what action ($ a = \\pi(s)$) to take in every state(s) so as to maximise the return. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of an agent $\\pi$ taking an action $a$ to get a state $s$ and reward $R$ is formally called a Markov Decision Process (MDP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Action Value Function\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The function can be defined as: $$\\begin{aligned} Q(s,a) = & \\text{ Return if you:} \\\\\n",
    "& \\text{   * Start in state } s \\\\\n",
    "& \\text{   * take action } a \\text{ (once)} \\\\\n",
    "& \\text{   * Then behave optimally after that} \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal return from state $s$ is $\\max_a Q(s,a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal action in state $s$ is the action $a$ that gives $\\max_a Q(s,a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bellman Equation \n",
    "\n",
    "The Bellman Equation can be defined with the following parameters:\n",
    "* $Q(s,a) =$ state action value function\n",
    "* $s =$ current state\n",
    "* $R(s) =$ reward of current state\n",
    "* $a =$ current action \n",
    "* $s' =$ state you get to after taking action $a$\n",
    "* $a' =$ action that you take in state $s'$\n",
    "* $\\gamma =$ the discount factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation can be defined as follows:\n",
    "$$ Q(s,a) = R(s) + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s',a')$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random (stochastic) environment\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if even though the system should choose the right action, a small percentage of the time the system \"slips\" and chooses the wrong action? This is what is known as a stochastic environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "To account for stochastic environments, we need to make an update for the return. Now Return becomes Expected Return = $E(R_1+\\gamma R_2 + \\gamma^2 R_3 + ...)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the Bellman equation becomes: \n",
    "$$ Q(s,a) = R(s) + \\gamma E[\\max_{a'} Q(s',a')]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous State Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning the state valued function \n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement reinforcement learning into a neural network to carry out deep reinforcement learning. In a state $s$, we will use a neural network to compute $Q(s,a)$ from a given input $\\vec{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} s \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a \\end{bmatrix}$. The neural network will be trained to pick the action $a$ that maximises $Q(s,a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning algorithm will be:\n",
    "1. Initialise neural network randomly as a guess of $Q(s,a)$. \n",
    "2. Repeat {\n",
    "    * Take actions to get $(s,a,R(s),s')$.\n",
    "    * Store $10,000$ most recent tuples $(s,a,R(s),s')$.\n",
    "    * Train neural network: \n",
    "      * Create training set of $10,000$ examples using $x=(s,a)$ and $y=R(s) + \\max_{a'} Q(s',a')$\n",
    "      * Train $Q_{new}$ such that $Q_{new}(s,a) \\approx y$\n",
    "    * Set $Q = Q_{new}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is sometimes called **DQN** or **Deep Q Network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Refining the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "##### $\\epsilon$-greedy policy\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose actions whilst still learning, we have some options. In some state $s$ one can: \n",
    "1. Pick the action $a$ that maximises $Q(s,a)$\n",
    "2. \n",
    "  * With probability $0.95$, pick the action $a$ that maximises $Q(s,a)$, Greedy, \"Exploitation\"\n",
    "  * With probability $0.05$, pick an action $a$ randomly. \"Exploration\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The picking of an action $a$ randomly is called a **$\\epsilon$-greedy policy**. You should start with a high $\\epsilon$ value and gradually decrease it. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mini batch and soft updates\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of mini batch gradient descent is to choose a batch of records to run gradient descent on, $m'$ which is smaller than $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using mini batch will mean that we need to update the algorithm. The soft update method \n",
    "hopes to prevent $Q_{new}$ getting worse.\n",
    "For $Q_{new}$, we set $w_{new} = \\phi w_{new} + (1-\\phi)w$ and $b = \\phi b_{new} + (1 -\\phi) b$, where $\\phi$ is a hyper parameter chosen by you with $\\phi \\ll 1$ (e.g. $\\phi  = 0.01$). \n",
    "\n",
    "So the final algorithm is:\n",
    "1. Initialise neural network randomly as a guess of $Q(s,a)$. \n",
    "2. Repeat {\n",
    "    * Take actions to get $(s,a,R(s),s')$.\n",
    "    * Store $1000$ most recent tuples $(s,a,R(s),s')$.\n",
    "    * Train neural network: \n",
    "      * Create training set of $1000$ examples using $x=(s,a)$ and $y=R(s) + \\max_{a'} Q(s',a')$\n",
    "      * Train $Q_{new}$ such that $Q_{new}(s,a) \\approx y$\n",
    "    * Set $Q = Q_{new}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The state of reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is an exciting set of technologies. However, there are a few limitations: \n",
    "* Much easier to get reinforcement learning to work in a simulation than a real robot. \n",
    "* Far fewer applications than supervised and unsupervised learning. "
